;; Version: 0.1
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "26.2"))

;;; Commentary:

;; Lets users call any existing function that jumps to another point,
;; adding additional (optional) scrolling functionality.
;;
;; - Re-center after the jump.
;; - Animate the scroll-motion by redrawing.

;;; Usage

;; See readme.rst.
